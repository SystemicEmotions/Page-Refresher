Page-Refresher
==============

Refreshes your page automatically for you.


There's a couple of things you need to know.
First of all, you'll need the selenium webdriver installed to work on this.
The reason why I used selenium was that, standalone python couldn't refresh a TAB without opening a new tab in its place.
I asked this on stackoverflow. They were the ones who told me to check out selenium

Now to install selenium you'll need to install pip.
If you dont have pip, you'll need to install the get-pip.py which can be found online.
Next update the selenium package with install.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you install the latest version of selenium otherwise your browser and selenium will be incompatible thereby causing a blank screen error when trying to load the page.

Now the code is written for Firefox, so if you dont have it please do install it.
Yes, its possible to run the script on Chrome, but you'll have to find the appropriate drivers.

Simply type in the URL in the command prompt as well as the number of seconds the browser waits to refresh it.

This can be used in instances when you're waiting for your results to come out, and you're not spamming that poor F5 key.
On sites like youtube, you can gather a large amount of views, till 300 to be precise.
